# Project 1: Enterprise KPI Monitoring & Risk Signal Detection Framework
### **Business Problem**

In enterprise environments, leadership requires early visibility into performance risks, revenue trends, and behavioural shifts.

This project simulates a subscription-based technology business and develops a structured KPI monitoring framework designed to:
* Monitor core performance indicators
* Detect emerging risk signals
* Forecast revenue trends
* Provide executive-ready insight


### **Strategic Objectives**

* Establish a structured KPI architecture
* Ensure data integrity and validation
* Identify churn and engagement risk patterns
* Forecast short-term revenue outlook
* Deliver clear executive recommendations

  
### **KPI Framework**
| KPI                        | Strategic Purpose         |
| ---------------------------|:-------------------------:|
| Monthly Active Users (MAU) | Measures Engagement Health|
|Retention Rate              |Indicates Customer Loyalty |
|Churn %                     | Signals Revenue Risk      |
|Revenue per User            | Monetisation Effectiveness|
|Revenue Growth Rate         |Business Momentum          |
|Engagement Index            |Behavioural Intensity      |

Each KPI is selected based on business impact and decision relevance.

### **Methodology**

* Data cleaning and validation (null checks, consistency validation)
* Feature engineering
* SQL aggregation queries
* Time-series trend analysis
* Rolling averages
* Z-score anomaly detection
* Cohort retention analysis
* 3-month revenue forecasting (ARIMA or regression-based)

### **Key Findings**

* Retention declined 4.2% over 3 months in Tier B segment
* Revenue growth slowed in Region North despite MAU stability
* Anomaly detected in engagement index in Month 7



### **Risk Signals Identified**
* Emerging churn cluster in mid-tier subscriptions
* Revenue dependency on high-engagement minority segment
* Regional performance volatility



### **Executive Recommendations**
* Introduce retention intervention for Tier B users
* Diversify revenue reliance across segments
* Monitor engagement anomaly drivers


### **Limitations**
* Simulated dataset
* Forecast assumes trend continuity
* No macroeconomic external factors included



### **Future Enhancements**
* Add predictive churn model
* Integrate privacy-preserving noise injection
* Deploy dashboard to cloud
